Originating as a class project, I expanded upon this pseudorandom, world-generating game to include features such as an improved user interface, randomly-moving guards, and a “boss battle” complete with graphics. Feel free to check out this video I made showcasing this project at this link https://youtu.be/KmQEehOWd8w.
